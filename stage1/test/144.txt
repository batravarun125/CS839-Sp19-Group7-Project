Inside the manse, the air was heavy with the scent of spices, pinchfire and sweet lemon
and cinnamon. They were escorted across the entry hall, where a mosaic of colored glass
depicted the Doom of Valyria. Oil burned in black iron lanterns all along the walls.
Beneath an arch of twining stone leaves, a eunuch sang their coming. “*Viserys* of the
House Targaryen, the Third of his Name,” he called in a high, sweet voice, “King of the
Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector
of the Realm. His sister, *Daenerys Stormborn*, Princess of Dragonstone. His honorable
host, *Illyrio Mopatis*, Magister of the Free City of Pentos.”
They stepped past the eunuch into a pillared courtyard overgrown in pale ivy. Moonlight
painted the leaves in shades of bone and silver as the guests drifted among them. Many
were Dothraki horselords, big men with red-brown skin, their drooping mustachios
bound in metal rings, their black hair oiled and braided and hung with bells. Yet among
them moved bravos and sellswords from Pentos and Myr and Tyrosh, a red priest even
fatter than *Illyrio*, hairy men from the Port of Ibben, and lords from the Summer Isles
with skin as black as ebony. *Daenerys* looked at them all in wonder . . . and realized, with
a sudden start of fear, that she was the only woman there.
