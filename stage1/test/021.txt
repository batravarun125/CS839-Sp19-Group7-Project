"He has gone fishing with *Misha* in the chaise. Did you see the horses yesterday? Those are their horses . . . *Vanya*'s . . . *Vanya* drives with them. Do you know what, *Grisha*? We will have *Misha* to stay with us. . . . We will, won't we? He is such a pretty boy. Such an exquisite boy!"

*Groholsky* pondered, while *Liza* went on talking and talking.

"This is an unexpected meeting," said *Groholsky*, after prolonged and, as usual, harrassing reflection. "Well, who could have expected that we should meet here? Well. . . There it is. . . . So be it. It seems that it is fated. I can imagine the awkwardness of his position when he meets us."

"Shall we have *Misha* to stay with us?"

"Yes, we will. . . . It will be awkward meeting him. . . . Why, what can I say to him? What can I talk of? It will be awkward for him and awkward for me. . . . We ought not to meet. We will carry on communications, if necessary, through the servants. . . . My head does ache so, *Lizotchka*. My arms and legs too, I ache all over. Is my head feverish?

*Liza* put her hand on his forehead and found that his head was hot.

"I had dreadful dreams all night . . . I shan't get up to-day. I shall stay in bed . . . I must take some quinine. Send me my breakfast here, little woman."

*Groholsky* took quinine and lay in bed the whole day. He drank warm water, moaned, had the sheets and pillowcase changed, whimpered, and induced an agonising boredom in all surrounding him.
