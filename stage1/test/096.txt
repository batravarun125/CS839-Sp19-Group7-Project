"My darling, my sweet, you are clever you know, you are unhappy," said *Nadya*. "You are very unhappy; why do you say such very dull, commonplace things? For God's sake, why?"

*Nina Ivanovna* tried to say something, but could not utter a word; she gave a sob and went away to her own room. The bass voices began droning in the stove again, and *Nadya* felt suddenly frightened. She jumped out of bed and went quickly to her mother. *Nina Ivanovna*, with tear-stained face, was lying in bed wrapped in a pale blue quilt and holding a book in her hands.

"Mother, listen to me!" said *Nadya*. "I implore you, do understand! If you would only understand how petty and degrading our life is. My eyes have been opened, and I see it all now. And what is your *Andrey Andreitch*? Why, he is not intelligent, mother! Merciful heavens, do understand, mother, he is stupid!"

*Nina Ivanovna* abruptly sat up.
