"You mustn't imagine they are just anybody," he said. "It is true they are French. They shout at the top of their voices, and drink . . . but we all know! The French are brought up to be like that! It can't be helped. . . . The prince," *Ivan Petrovitch* added, "let me have them almost for nothing. . . . He said: 'take them, take them. . . .' I must introduce you to the prince sometime. A man of culture! He's for ever writing, writing. . . . And do you know what their names are? One is Fanny, the other *Isabella*. . . . There's Europe, ha-ha-ha! . . . The west! Good-bye!"

*Ivan Petrovitch* left *Liza* and *Groholsky* in peace, and devoted himself to his ladies. All day long sound of talk, laughter, and the clatter of crockery came from his villa. . . . The lights were not put out till far into the night. . . . *Groholsky* was in bliss. . . . At last, after a prolonged interval of agony, he felt happy and at peace again. Ivan Petrovitch with his two ladies had no such happiness as he had with one. But alas, destiny has no heart. She plays with the Groholskys, the Lizas, the Ivans, and the Mishutkas as with pawns. . . . *Groholsky* lost his peace again. . . .

One morning, about ten days afterwards, on waking up late, he went out on to the verandah and saw a spectacle which shocked him, revolted him, and moved him to intense indignation. Under the verandah of the villa opposite stood the French women, and between them *Liza*. She was talking and looking askance at her own villa as though to see whether that tyrant, that despot were awake (so *Groholsky* interpreted those looks). *Ivan Petrovitch* standing on the verandah with his sleeves tucked up, lifted *Isabella* into the air, then *Fanny*, and then *Liza*. When he was lifting *Liza* it seemed to *Groholsky* that he pressed her to himself. . . . *Liza* too flung one leg over the parapet. . . . Oh these women! All sphinxes, every one of them!
