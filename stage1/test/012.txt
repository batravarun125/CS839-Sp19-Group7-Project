"*Ivan Petrovitch*, do not torture me! Will you take a hundred thousand?"

"Hm . . . a hundred and fifty thousand!" muttered *Bugrov* in a hollow voice, the voice of a husky bull. He muttered it, and bowed his head, ashamed of his words, and awaiting the answer.

"Good," said *Groholsky*, "I agree. I thank you, *Ivan Petrovitch* . . . . In a minute. . . . I will not keep you waiting. . . ."

*Groholsky* jumped up, put on his hat, and staggering backwards, ran out of the drawing-room

*Bugrov* clutched the window curtains more tightly than ever. . . . He was ashamed . . . . There was a nasty, stupid feeling in his soul, but, on the other hand, what fair shining hopes swarmed between his throbbing temples! He was rich!

*Liza*, who had grasped nothing of what was happening, darted through the half-opened door trembling all over and afraid that he would come to her window and fling her away from it. She went into the nursery, laid herself down on the nurse's bed, and curled herself up. She was shivering with fever.

*Bugrov* was left alone. He felt stifled, and he opened the window. What glorious air breathed fragrance on his face and neck! It would be good to breathe such air lolling on the cushions of a carriage. . . . Out there, far beyond the town, among the villages and the summer villas, the air was sweeter still. . . . *Bugrov* actually smiled as he dreamed of the air that would be about him when he would go out on the verandah of his villa and admire the view. A long while he dreamed. . . . The sun had set, and still he stood and dreamed, trying his utmost to cast out of his mind the image of *Liza* which obstinately pursued him in all his dreams.
