"That doesn't matter. We can't help that in our work. And how is *Anna Erastovna*?"

"My daughter? She is all right, she's skipping about. Last week on the Wednesday we betrothed her to *Sheikin*. Why didn't you come?"

The scissors cease snipping. *Makar Kuzmitch* drops his hands and asks in a fright:

"Who is betrothed?"

"Anna."

"How's that? To whom?"

"To *Sheikin*. *Prokofy Petrovitch*. His aunt's a housekeeper in Zlatoustensky Lane. She is a nice woman. Naturally we are all delighted, thank God. The wedding will be in a week. Mind you come; we will have a good time."

"But how's this, *Erast Ivanitch*?" says *Makar Kuzmitch*, pale, astonished, and shrugging his shoulders. "It's . . . it's utterly impossible. Why, *Anna Erastovna* . . . why I . . . why, I cherished sentiments for her, I had intentions. How could it happen?"

Cold drops of perspiration come on the face of *Makar Kuzmitch*. He puts the scissors down on the table and begins rubbing his nose with his fist.

"I had intentions," he says. "It's impossible, *Erast Ivanitch*. I . . . I am in love with her and have made her the offer of my heart. . . . And auntie promised. I have always respected you as though you were my father. . . . I always cut your hair for nothing. . . . I have always obliged you, and when my papa died you took the sofa and ten roubles in cash and have never given them back. Do you remember?"
