That year *Bugrov*, too, visited the Crimea. He did not take the villa opposite, but pottered about, going from one town to another with *Mishutka*. He spent his time eating, drinking, sleeping, and playing cards. He had lost all relish for fishing, shooting and the French women, who, between ourselves, had robbed him a bit. He had grown thin, lost his broad and beaming smiles, and had taken to dressing in canvas. *Ivan Petrovitch* from time to time visited *Groholsky*'s villa. He brought *Liza* jam, sweets, and fruit, and seemed trying to dispel her ennui. *Groholsky* was not troubled by these visits, especially as they were brief and infrequent, and were apparently paid on account of *Mishutka*, who could not under any circumstances have been altogether deprived of the privilege of seeing his mother. *Bugrov* came, unpacked his presents, and after saying a few words, departed. And those few words he said not to *Liza* but to *Groholsky*. . . . With *Liza* he was silent and *Groholsky*'s mind was at rest; but there is a Russian proverb which he would have done well to remember: "Don't fear the dog that barks, but fear the dog that's quiet. . . ." A fiendish proverb, but in practical life sometimes indispensable.

As he was walking in the garden one day, *Groholsky* heard two voices in conversation. One voice was a man's, the other was a woman's. One belonged to *Bugrov*, the other to *Liza*. *Groholsky* listened, and turning white as death, turned softly towards the speakers. He halted behind a lilac bush, and proceeded to watch and listen. His arms and legs turned cold. A cold sweat came out upon his brow. He clutched several branches of the lilac that he might not stagger and fall down. All was over!

*Bugrov* had his arm round *Liza*' s waist, and was saying to her:

"My darling! what are we to do? It seems it was God's will. . . . I am a scoundrel. . . . I sold you. I was seduced by that *Herod*'s money, plague take him, and what good have I had from the money? Nothing but anxiety and display! No peace, no happiness, no position. . . . One sits like a fat invalid at the same spot, and never a step forwarder. . . . Have you heard that *Andrushka Markuzin* has been made a head clerk? *Andrushka*, that fool! While I stagnate. . . . Good heavens! I have lost you, I have lost my happiness. I am a scoundrel, a blackguard, how do you think I shall feel at the dread day of judgment?"
