It is not yet seven o'clock, but *Makar Kuzmitch Blyostken*'s shop is already open. The barber himself, an unwashed, greasy, but foppishly dressed youth of three and twenty, is busy clearing up; there is really nothing to be cleared away, but he is perspiring with his exertions. In one place he polishes with a rag, in another he scrapes with his finger or catches a bug and brushes it off the wall.

This is *Erast Ivanitch Yagodov*, *Makar Kuzmitch*'s godfather. At one time he served as a watchman in the Consistory, now he lives near the Red Pond and works as a locksmith.

"*Makarushka*, good-day, dear boy!" he says to *Makar Kuzmitch*, who is absorbed in tidying up.

They kiss each other. *Yagodov* drags his shawl off his head, crosses himself, and sits down.

With a scrape of his foot *Makar Kuzmitch* indicates a chair. *Yagodov* sits down and looks at himself in the glass and is apparently pleased with his reflection: the looking-glass displays a face awry, with Kalmuck lips, a broad, blunt nose, and eyes in the forehead. Makar Kuzmitch puts round his client's shoulders a white sheet with yellow spots on it, and begins snipping with the scissors.
