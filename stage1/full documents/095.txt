"Mother, mother, my own," she said. "If only you knew what is happening to me! I beg you, I beseech you, let me go away! I beseech you!"

"Where?" asked *Nina Ivanovna*, not understanding, and she sat down on the bedstead. "Go where?"

For a long while *Nadya* cried and could not utter a word.

"Let me go away from the town," she said at last. "There must not and will not be a wedding, understand that! I don't love that man . . . I can't even speak about him."

"No, my own, no!" *Nina Ivanovna* said quickly, terribly alarmed. "Calm yourself -- it's just because you are in low spirits. It will pass, it often happens. Most likely you have had a tiff with *Andrey*; but lovers' quarrels always end in kisses!"

"Oh, go away, mother, oh, go away," sobbed *Nadya*.

"Yes," said *Nina Ivanovna* after a pause, "it's not long since you were a baby, a little girl, and now you are engaged to be married. In nature there is a continual transmutation of substances. Before you know where you are you will be a mother yourself and an old woman, and will have as rebellious a daughter as I have."
