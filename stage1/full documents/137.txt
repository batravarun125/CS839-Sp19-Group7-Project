When she was clean, the slaves helped her from the water and toweled her dry. The girl
brushed her hair until it shone like molten silver, while the old woman anointed her with
the spiceflower perfume of the Dothraki plains, a dab on each wrist, behind her ears, on
the tips of her breasts, and one last one, cool on her lips, down there between her legs.
They dressed her in the wisps that *Magister Illyrio* had sent up, and then the gown, a
deep plum silk to bring out the violet in her eyes. The girl slid the gilded sandals onto her
feet, while the old woman fixed the tiara in her hair, and slid golden bracelets crusted
with amethysts around her wrists. Last of all came the collar, a heavy golden torc
emblazoned with ancient Valyrian glyphs.
“Now you look all a princess,” the girl said breathlessly when they were done. *Dany* glanced at her image in the silvered looking glass that *Illyrio* had so thoughtfully
provided. A princess, she thought, but she remembered what the girl had said, how *Khal Drogo* was so rich even his slaves wore golden collars. She felt a sudden chill, and 
gooseflesh pimpled her bare arms.
