"*Porfiry*," cried the fat man on seeing the thin man. "Is it you? My dear fellow! How many summers, how many winters!"

"Holy saints!" cried the thin man in amazement. "*Misha*! The friend of my childhood! Where have you dropped from?"

The friends kissed each other three times, and gazed at each other with eyes full of tears. Both were agreeably astounded.

"My dear boy!" began the thin man after the kissing. "This is unexpected! This is a surprise! Come have a good look at me! Just as handsome as I used to be! Just as great a darling and a dandy! Good gracious me! Well, and how are you? Made your fortune? Married? I am married as you see. . . . This is my wife *Luise*, her maiden name was *Vantsenbach* . . . of the Lutheran persuasion. . . . And this is my son *Nafanail*, a schoolboy in the third class. This is the friend of my childhood, *Nafanya*. We were boys at school together!"

*Nafanail* thought a little and took off his cap.

"We were boys at school together," the thin man went on. "Do you remember how they used to tease you? You were nicknamed *Herostratus* because you burned a hole in a schoolbook with a cigarette, and I was nicknamed *Ephialtes* because I was fond of telling tales. Ho--ho! . . . we were children! . . . Don't be shy, *Nafanya*. Go nearer to him. And this is my wife, her maiden name was *Vantsenbach*, of the Lutheran persuasion. . . ."
