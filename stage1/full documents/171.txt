"The examining magistrate has just been with the police," answered *Vassily*; "they've made a search."

*Avdeyev* looked round him. The cupboards, the chests, the tables -- everything bore traces of the recent search. For a minute *Avdeyev* stood motionless as though petrified, unable to understand; then his whole inside quivered and seemed to grow heavy, his left leg went numb, and, unable to endure his trembling, he lay down flat on the sofa. He felt his inside heaving and his rebellious left leg tapping against the back of the sofa.

In the course of two or three minutes he recalled the whole of his past, but could not remember any crime deserving of the attention of the police.

"It's all nonsense," he said, getting up. "They must have slandered me. Tomorrow I must lodge a complaint of their having dared to do such a thing."

Next morning after a sleepless night *Avdeyev*, as usual, went to his shop. His customers brought him the news that during the night the public prosecutor had sent the deputy manager and the head-clerk to prison as well. This news did not disturb *Avdeyev*. He was convinced that he had been slandered, and that if he were to lodge a complaint to-day the examining magistrate would get into trouble for the search of the night before.
