After this *Andrey Yefimitch* began to notice a mysterious air in all around him. The attendants, the nurses, and the patients looked at him inquisitively when they met him, and then whispered together. The superintendent's little daughter Masha, whom he liked to meet in the hospital garden, for some reason ran away from him now when he went up with a smile to stroke her on the head. The postmaster no longer said, "Perfectly true," as he listened to him, but in unaccountable confusion muttered, "Yes, yes, yes . . ." and looked at him with a grieved and thoughtful expression; for some reason he took to advising his friend to give up vodka and beer, but as a man of delicate feeling he did not say this directly, but hinted it, telling him first about the commanding officer of his battalion, an excellent man, and then about the priest of the regiment, a capital fellow, both of whom drank and fell ill, but on giving up drinking completely regained their health. On two or three occasions *Andrey Yefimitch* was visited by his colleague *Hobotov*, who also advised him to give up spirituous liquors, and for no apparent reason recommended him to take bromide.

In August *Andrey Yefimitch* got a letter from the mayor of the town asking him to come on very important business. On arriving at the town hall at the time fixed, *Andrey Yefimitch *found there the military commander, the superintendent of the district school, a member of the town council, *Hobotov*, and a plump, fair gentleman who was introduced to him as a doctor. This doctor, with a Polish surname difficult to pronounce, lived at a pedigree stud-farm twenty miles away, and was now on a visit to the town.
