It was the benefit night of Fenogenov, the tragic actor. They were acting "Prince *Serebryany*." The tragedian himself was playing *Vyazemsky*; *Limonadov*, the stage manager, was playing *Morozov*; Madame *Beobahtov*, *Elena*. The performance was a grand success. The tragedian accomplished wonders indeed. When he was carrying off *Elena*, he held her in one hand above his head as he dashed across the stage. He shouted, hissed, banged with his feet, tore his coat across his chest. When he refused to fight *Morozov*, he trembled all over as nobody ever trembles in reality, and gasped loudly. The theatre shook with applause. There were endless calls. *Fenogenov* was presented with a silver cigarette-case and a bouquet tied with long ribbons. The ladies waved their handkerchiefs and urged their men to applaud, many shed tears. . . . But the one who was the most enthusiastic and most excited was *Masha*, daughter of *Sidoretsky* the police captain. She was sitting in the first row of the stalls beside her papa; she was ecstatic and could not take her eyes off the stage even between the acts. Her delicate little hands and feet were quivering, her eyes were full of tears, her cheeks turned paler and paler. And no wonder -- she was at the theatre for the first time in her life.

"How well they act! how splendidly!" she said to her papa the police captain, every time the curtain fell. How good *Fenogenov* is!"
