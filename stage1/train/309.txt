Besides *Big Volodya*, *Little Volodya*, and *Sofya Lvovna*, there was a fourth person in the sledge -- *Margarita Alexandrovna*, or, as every one called her, *Rita*, a cousin of Madame *Yagitch* -- a very pale girl over thirty, with black eyebrows and a pince-nez, who was for ever smoking cigarettes, even in the bitterest frost, and who always had her knees and the front of her blouse covered with cigarette ash. She spoke through her nose, drawling every word, was of a cold temperament, could drink any amount of wine and liquor without being drunk, and used to tell scandalous anecdotes in a languid and tasteless way. At home she spent her days reading thick magazines, covering them with cigarette ash, or eating frozen apples.
