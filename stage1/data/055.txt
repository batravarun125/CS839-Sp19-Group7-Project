"*Ivan Alexeitch*!" the clerk shouted into the air as though he had not observed *Voldyrev*, "will you tell the merchant *Yalikov* when he comes to sign the copy of the complaint lodged with the police! I've told him a thousand times!"

"I have come in reference to my lawsuit with the heirs of Princess *Gugulin*," muttered *Voldyrev*. "The case is well known. I earnestly beg you to attend to me."

Still failing to observe Voldyrev, the clerk caught the fly on his lip, looked at it attentively and flung it away. The country gentleman coughed and blew his nose loudly on his checked pocket handkerchief. But this was no use either. He was still unheard. The silence lasted for two minutes. *Voldyrev* took a rouble note from his pocket and laid it on an open book before the clerk. The clerk wrinkled up his forehead, drew the book towards him with an anxious air and closed it.

"A little inquiry. . . . I want only to find out on what grounds the heirs of Princess *Gugulin*. . . . May I trouble you?"

*Voldyrev* went back to the table and laid a green note on the open book.

The clerk drew the book towards him again and began turning over the leaves, and all at once, as though by chance, lifted his eyes to *Voldyrev*. His nose began to shine, turned red, and wrinkled up in a grin.

"Ah . . . what do you want?" he asked.

"I want to make an inquiry in reference to my case. . . . My name is *Voldyrev*."

"With pleasure! The *Gugulin* case, isn't it? Very good. What is it then exactly?"

*Voldyrev* explained his business.
