"I have brought it, *Ivan Petrovitch*!" *Groholsky*, re-entering, whispered above his ear. "I have brought it -- take it. . . . Here in this roll there are forty thousand. . . . With this cheque will you kindly get twenty the day after to-morrow from Valentinov? . . . Here is a bill of exchange . . . a cheque. . . . The remaining thirty thousand in a day or two. . . . My steward will bring it to you."

*Groholsky*, pink and excited, with all his limbs in motion, laid before *Bugrov* a heap of rolls of notes and bundles of papers. The heap was big, and of all sorts of hues and tints. Never in the course of his life had *Bugrov* seen such a heap. He spread out his fat fingers and, not looking at *Groholsky*, fell to going through the bundles of notes and bonds. . . .

*Groholsky* spread out all the money, and moved restlessly about the room, looking for the Dulcinea who had been bought and sold.

Filling his pockets and his pocket-book, *Bugrov* thrust the securities into the table drawer, and, drinking off half a decanter full of water, dashed out into the street.

"Cab!" he shouted in a frantic voice.

At half-past eleven that night he drove up to the entrance of the Paris Hotel. He went noisily upstairs and knocked at the door of *Groholsky*'s apartments. He was admitted. *Groholsky* was packing his things in a portmanteau, *Liza* was sitting at the table trying on bracelets. They were both frightened when *Bugrov* went in to them. They fancied that he had come for *Liza* and had brought back the money which he had taken in haste without reflection. But *Bugrov* had not come for *Liza*. Ashamed of his new get-up and feeling frightfully awkward in it, he bowed and stood at the door in the attitude of a flunkey. The get-up was superb. *Bugrov* was unrecognisable. His huge person, which had never hitherto worn anything but a uniform, was clothed in a fresh, brand-new suit of fine French cloth and of the most fashionable cut. On his feet spats shone with sparkling buckles. He stood ashamed of his new get-up, and with his right hand covered the watch-chain for which he had, an hour before, paid three hundred roubles.
