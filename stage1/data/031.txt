When *Liza* returned home from her husband's villa and went into the bedroom on tip-toe, as though nothing had happened, *Groholsky*, pale, with hectic flushes on his cheeks, was lying in the attitude of a man at his last gasp and moaning.

On seeing *Liza*, he sprang out of bed, and began pacing about the bedroom.

*Liza* turned pale, and of course burst into tears. When women feel that they are in the right, they scold and shed tears; when they are conscious of being in fault, they shed tears only.

*Groholsky* said a great many more valiant and stinging things, but did not "go at once"; he felt timid and abashed. . . . He went to *Ivan Petrovitch* three days later.

When he went into his apartment, he gaped with astonishment. He was amazed at the wealth and luxury with which *Bugrov* had surrounded himself. Velvet hangings, fearfully expensive chairs. . . . One was positively ashamed to step on the carpet. *Groholsky* had seen many rich men in his day, but he had never seen such frenzied luxury. . . . And the higgledy-piggledy muddle he saw when, with an inexplicable tremor, he walked into the drawing-room -- plates with bits of bread on them were lying about on the grand piano, a glass was standing on a chair, under the table there was a basket with a filthy rag in it. . . . Nut shells were strewn about in the windows. *Bugrov* himself was not quite in his usual trim when *Groholsky* walked in. . . . With a red face and uncombed locks he was pacing about the room in deshabille, talking to himself, apparently much agitated. *Mishutka* was sitting on the sofa there in the drawing-room, and was making the air vibrate with a piercing scream.
