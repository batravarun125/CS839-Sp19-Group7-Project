*Liza* was bored to death. *Groholsky* suffered too. He had to go for his walks alone without a companion. He almost shed tears, but . . . had to submit to his fate. And to make things worse, *Bugrov* would run across every morning and in a hissing whisper would give some quite unnecessary bulletin concerning the health of Father *Pyotr*. He bored them with those bulletins.

"He slept well," he informed them. "Yesterday he was put out because I had no salted cucumbers. . . He has taken to *Mishutka*; he keeps patting him on the head."

At last, a fortnight later, little Father *Pyotr* walked for the last time round the villas and, to *Groholsky*'s immense relief, departed. He had enjoyed himself, and went off very well satisfied. *Liza* and *Groholsky* fell back into their old manner of life. *Groholsky* once more blessed his fate. But his happiness did not last for long. A new trouble worse than Father *Pyotr* followed. *Ivan Petrovitch* took to coming to see them every day. *Ivan Petrovitch*, to be frank, though a capital fellow, was a very tedious person. He came at dinner-time, dined with them and stayed a very long time. That would not have mattered. But they had to buy vodka, which *Groholsky* could not endure, for his dinner. He would drink five glasses and talk the whole dinner-time. That, too, would not have mattered. . . . But he would sit on till two o'clock in the morning, and not let them get to bed, and, worse still, he permitted himself to talk of things about which he should have been silent. When towards two o'clock in the morning he had drunk too much vodka and champagne, he would take *Mishutka* in his arms, and weeping, say to him, before *Groholsky* and *Liza*:

"*Mihail*, my son, what am I? I . . . am a scoundrel. I have sold your mother! Sold her for thirty pieces of silver, may the Lord punish me! *Mihail Ivanitch*, little sucking pig, where is your mother? Lost! Gone! Sold into slavery! Well, I am a scoundrel."
