"It's awful, *Grigory Vassilyevitch*!" *Bugrov* began on seeing *Groholsky*, "such disorder. . . such disorder. . . Please sit down. You must excuse my being in the costume of Adam and Eve. . . . It's of no consequence. . . . Horrible disorderliness! I don't understand how people can exist here, I don't understand it! The servants won't do what they are told, the climate is horrible, everything is expensive. . . . Stop your noise," *Bugrov* shouted, suddenly coming to a halt before *Mishutka*; "stop it, I tell you! Little beast, won't you stop it?"

And *Bugrov* pulled *Mishutka*'s ear.

"That's revolting, *Ivan Petrovitch*," said *Groholsky* in a tearful voice. "How can you treat a tiny child like that? You really are. . ."

"Let him stop yelling then. . . . Be quiet -- I'll whip you!"

"Don't cry, dear *Misha*. . . . *Papa* won't touch you again. Don't beat him, *Ivan Petrovitch*; why, he is hardly more than a baby. . . . There, there. . . . Would you like a little horse? I'll send you a little horse. . . . You really are hard-hearted. . . ."

*Groholsky* paused, and then asked:

"And how are your ladies getting on, *Ivan Petrovitch*?"

"Not at all. I've turned them out without ceremony. I might have gone on keeping them, but it's awkward. . . . The boy will grow up. . . . A father's example. . . . If I were alone, then it would be a different thing. . . . Besides, what's the use of my keeping them? Poof . . . it's a regular farce! I talk to them in Russian, and they answer me in French. They don't understand a thing -- you can't knock anything into their heads."
