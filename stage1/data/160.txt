He was more interested in the pair that came behind him: the queen’s brothers, the
Lannisters of Casterly Rock. The Lion and the Imp; there was no mistaking which was
which. Ser *Jaime Lannister* was twin to Queen *Cersei*; tall and golden, with flashing
green eyes and a smile that cut like a knife. He wore crimson silk, high black boots, a
black satin cloak. On the breast of his tunic, the lion of his House was embroidered in
gold thread, roaring its defiance. They called him the Lion of Lannister to his face and
the Kingslayer behind his back.
*Jon* found it hard to look away from him. This is what a king should look like, he
thought to himself as the man passed.
Then he saw the other one, waddling along half-hidden by his brother’s side. *Tyrion
Lannister*, the youngest of Lord *Tywin*’s brood and by far the ugliest. All that the gods
had given to *Cersei* and *Jaime*, they had denied *Tyrion*. He was a dwarf, half his
brother’s height, struggling to keep pace on stunted legs. His head was too large for his
body, with a brute’s squashed-in face beneath a swollen shelf of brow. One green eye and
one black one peered out from under a lank fall of hair so blond it seemed white. *Jon*
watched him with fascination.
