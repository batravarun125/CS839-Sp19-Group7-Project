*The documents we obtained are from Chekhov’s short stories.   
*We only selected some fragments from each story and got 320 documents in total.   
*In this project, we’d like to extract person names from these documents.   
*For example, we’d like to extract “Otchumyelov” from “The police superintendent Otchumyelov is walking across the market square wearing a new overcoat and carrying a parcel under his arm”.   
*In these documents, we marked each person name as *NAME*, which will cover first name and last name while prefix and suffix are not included.
