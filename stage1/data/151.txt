By then the others were dismounting as well, and grooms were coming forward for their
mounts. *Robert*’s queen, *Cersei Lannister*, entered on foot with her younger children.
The wheelhouse in which they had ridden, a huge double-decked carriage of oiled oak
and gilded metal pulled by forty heavy draft horses, was too wide to pass through the
castle gate. *Ned* knelt in the snow to kiss the queen’s ring, while *Robert* embraced
*Catelyn* like a long-lost sister. Then the children had been brought forward, introduced,
and approved of by both sides.
No sooner had those formalities of greeting been completed than the king had said to his
host, “Take me down to your crypt, *Eddard*. I would pay my respects.”
*Ned* loved him for that, for remembering her still after all these years. He called for a
lantern. No other words were needed. The queen had begun to protest. They had been
riding since dawn, everyone was tired and cold, surely they should refresh themselves
first. The dead would wait. She had said no more than that; *Robert* had looked at her,
and her twin brother *Jaime* had taken her quietly by the arm, and she had said no more.
